# S.P.E.A.C

S.P.E.A.C, or Sensory Personalized EMG based Assistive Communication, is an interface that leverages Electromyography) technology to provide a user-centric experience. S.P.E.A.C’s goal is inclusion and accessibility, as I’d like to eventually create an interface that is affordable, accessible and accurate as possible

The S.P.E.A.C Interface is an interactive html locally-run web application designed to aid individuals who are unable to speak or have limited verbal communication abilities. Through user-friendly visuals, the board presents a grid of communication options, each representing specific needs or requests, such as 'I'm Hungry', 'I'm Thirsty', or 'Please turn on the TV'.

Electrodes are placed on the user's temples, as even lightly touching your teeth together can generate enough of a potential to pass program thresholds. The program scans through the options, highlighting the options one at a time. The user can stop the scanning by letting their teeth touch, which generates an electrical potential, and the final selection is highlighted.
